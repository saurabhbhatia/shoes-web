I'm sure you're wondering: do I need to install Ruby? Do I need to unzip anything? What commands to I need to type?</p></div><p>Nope. You don't need Ruby. You don't need WinZip. Nothing to type.</p><p>On most systems, starting Shoes is just a matter of running the installer and clicking the Shoes icon.  Shoes comes with everything built in. We'll talk through all the steps, though, just to be clear about it.</p><h4>Step 1: Installing Shoes</h4><p>You'll want to visit <a href="http://shoooes.net/" target="_new">shoooes.net</a> to download the Shoes installer.  Usually, you'll just want one of the installers on the top corner of the home page. <img src="static/man-builds.png" /></p><p>Here's how to run the installer:</p><ul><li>On <strong>Mac OS X</strong>, you'll have a file ending with <strong>.dmg</strong>.  Double-click this file and a window should appear with a <strong>Shoes</strong> icon and an <strong>Applications</strong> folder.  Following the arrow, drag the Shoes icon into the <strong>Applications</strong> folder. <img src="static/man-intro-dmg.png" /> </li><li>On <strong>Windows</strong>, you'll download a <strong>.exe</strong> file.  Double-click this file and follow the instructions. <img src="static/man-intro-exe.png" /> </li><li>On <strong>Linux</strong>, you'll download a file ending with <strong>.run</strong>.  Double-click this file and Shoes will start up.  (You can also run this file from a prompt as if it was a shell script.  In fact, it is a shell script!)</li></ul><h4>Step 2: Start a New Text File</h4><p>Shoes programs are just plain text files ending with a <strong>.rb</strong> extension.</p><p>Here are a few ways to create a blank text file:</p><ul><li>On <strong>Mac OS X</strong>, visit your <strong>Applications</strong> folder and double-click on the <strong>TextEdit</strong> app.  A blank editor window should come up.  Now, go to the <strong>Format</strong> menu and select the <strong>Make Plain Text</strong> option.  Okay, you're all set! <img src="static/man-editor-osx.png" /> </li><li>On <strong>Windows</strong>, go to the Start menu.  Select <strong>All Programs</strong>, then <strong>Accessories</strong>, then <strong>Notepad</strong>. <img src="static/man-editor-notepad.png" /> </li><li>On <strong>Linux</strong>, most distros come with <strong>gedit</strong>.  You might try running that.  Or, if your distro is KDE-based, run <strong>kate</strong>.</li></ul><p>Now, in your blank window, type in the following:</p><pre><code class="rb"> Shoes.app do
   background &quot;#DFA&quot;
   para &quot;Welcome to Shoes&quot;
 end
</code></pre><p>Save to your desktop as <code>welcome.rb</code>.</p><h4>Step 3: Run It! Go Shoes!</h4><p>To run your program:</p><ul><li>On <strong>Mac OS X</strong>, visit your <strong>Applications</strong> folder again.  This time, double-click the <strong>Shoes</strong> icon in that folder.  You should see the red shoes icon appear in the dock.  Drag your <code>welcome.rb</code> from the desktop on to that dock icon. <img src="static/man-run-osx.png" /> </li><li>On <strong>Windows</strong>, get to the Start menu.  Go into <strong>All Programs</strong>, then <strong>Shoes</strong>, then <strong>Shoes</strong>.  A file selector box should come up.  Browse to your desktop and select <code>welcome.rb</code>.  Click <strong>OK</strong> and you're on your way. <img src="static/man-run-xp.png" /> <img src="static/man-run-vista.png" /> </li><li>On <strong>Linux</strong>, run Shoes just like you did in step one.  You should see a file selector box.  Browse to your desktop, select <code>welcome.rb</code> and hit <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ul><p>So, not much of a program yet.  But it's something!  You've got the knack of it, at least!</p><h4>What Can You Make With Shoes?</h4><p>Well, you can make windowing applications. But Shoes is inspired by the web, so applications tend to use images and text layout rather than a lot of widgets. For example, Shoes doesn't come with tabbed controls or toolbars. Shoes is a <em>tiny</em> toolkit, remember?</p><p>Still, Shoes does have a few widgets like buttons and edit boxes. And many missing elements (like tabbed controls or toolbars) can be simulated with images.</p><p>Shoes is written in part thanks to a very good art engine called Cairo, which is used for drawing with shapes and colors. In this way, Shoes is inspired by NodeBox and Processing, two very good languages for drawing animated graphics.</p><p class="next">Next: <a href="Rules.html">The Rules of Shoes</a></p></div><div class="sidebar"><img src="static/shoes-icon.png" /><ul><li><a class="prime" href="./">HELP</a></li><li><a href="Hello.html">Hello!</a><ul class="sub"><li><a href="Introducing.html">Introducing</a></li><li><a href="Installing.html">Installing</a></li><li><a href="Rules.html">Rules</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="Shoes.html">Shoes</a></li><li><a href="Slots.html">Slots</a></li><li><a href="Elements.html">Elements</a></li></ul></div></div></body></html>
